# Bongocat for the Lily58

Bongocat on your Lily58 Keyboard!!
Modified from the Corne Keyboard version by ObliviousGmn to include proper screen off timeouts using workarounds.
Features my own layer layout and keymap inspired by the Corne layer layout.

As the timeout is dependant on the wpm (words per minute), I assume the timeout starts after one minute.
The timeout can be set in "brain.c" under the variable "oled_timeout" in milliseconds.
